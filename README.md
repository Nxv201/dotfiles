## Introduction
A collection of configs to be placed in the user's home directory usually prefixed with a period, hence the name dotfiles.
This repo is actually intended for my personal backup, but everyone is welcome to use these resources. 
Maybe not always up to date with my current setup.
I hope this will be useful.
And remember, copying configuration file doesn't make it instantly work <br />
